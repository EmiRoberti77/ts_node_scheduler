# Node-Schedule Job Example

This document provides an example of using the `node-schedule` library to schedule a task in Node.js. The example demonstrates how to execute a job every minute at the 56th second.

---

## Code Example

```typescript
import schedule from "node-schedule";

const job = schedule.scheduleJob("56 * * * * *", () => {
  console.log("job", new Date().toISOString());
});
```

### Explanation:

- **`schedule.scheduleJob`**: Schedules a job using a cron-style syntax.
- **Cron Syntax**:
  - `56 * * * * *`
    - **56**: At the 56th second of every minute.
    - `* * * * *`: Matches all other time components (minute, hour, day, etc.).
- **Callback Function**: Logs the current date and time whenever the job is executed.

## Steps to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure `node-schedule` is installed in your project:

   ```bash
   npm install node-schedule
   ```

2. **Run the Code**:
   Execute the script using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node your_script_name.js
   ```

3. **Expected Output**:
   The console will log the following message at the 56th second of every minute:
   ```
   job 2025-01-21T15:56:56.000Z
   ```

---

## Notes

- **Precision**: The job executes as closely as possible to the specified time, but slight delays may occur due to system limitations.
- **Cron Style Reference**:
  - `second minute hour day month dayOfWeek`
  - Example: `56 * * * * *` runs at the 56th second of every minute.
